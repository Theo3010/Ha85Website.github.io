Ha85, also know as Hvinningdal Aktivitetsforening 1985, is an organisation in Denmark, and this is NOT THE OFFICIEL website for that organisation. This is a school projcet to remake an already exiting webiste. And this is my atempt.

Main page, with interactive background and titile. The background is clickable and will redirect you to the corresponding page.

<h1>Development</h1>
This is my first time trying to make an realy website. I have been working with website a bit, but only basic knowledge.

<h1>Build</h1>
This is a flask program, wich means it's running with python. So to run the website by your self, you have to have python. If so download the entire folder and run the python program. Ngrok is also a part of the projekt, but that only to make the website accessible to other people for a temporary connection.
